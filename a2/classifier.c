 * main() takes in 2 command line arguments:
 *    - training_data: A binary file containing training image / label data
 *    - testing_data: A binary file containing testing image / label data
 *
 * You need to do the following:
 *    - Parse the command line arguments, call `load_dataset()` appropriately.
 *    - Call `make_dec_tree()` to build the decision tree with training data
 *    - For each test image, call `dec_tree_classify()` and compare the real 
 *        label with the predicted label
 *    - Print out (only) one integer to stdout representing the number of 
 *        test images that were correctly classified.
 *    - Free all the data dynamically allocated and exit.
